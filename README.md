# Life expectancy - more equity for everyone!
---

Life expectancy varies across Europe. To understand this variation and to draw conclusions on how to reach more equity for everyone, we analyzed the influence of education, income and governmental expenditure on life expectancy. Influences were checked for the four European regions (East Europe, North Europe, South Europe, West Europe). 

We searched different datasets from:
- WHO (Health for all [HFA-DB], Health Enhancing Physical Activity dataset [HEPA], Global Health Expenditure Database [GHED]), the OECD (Programme for International Student Assessment [PISA])
- UN (Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey [MICS], SYB66_1_202310_Population, Surface Area and Density, SYB66_325_202310_Expenditure on health, SYB66_245_202310_Public expenditure on education and access to computers, SYB66_329_202310_Labour Force and Unemployment, SYB66_309_202310_Education)
- Health Behaviour in School-aged Children Survey [HBSC]

Exploratory data analysis was conducted on the datasets and countries of all datasets were grouped into the four European regions. 

The final merged dataset used for our in-depth analyses includes data from HFA-DB, GHED, PISA and SYB66. Differences across European regions were found for life expectancy, education, income and governemental spending. The results showed significant correlations between life expectancy, education (school enrollment, school performance), gross national income as well as governmental spending on health and education. To foster equity, governments should make spending on education and health a national priority, education for all as well as a minimum income to cover health and education costs should be guaranteed.
